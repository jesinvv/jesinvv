                    <p>This workflow outlines the step-by-step process for analyzing insurance claim data in a hospital setting. It begins with defining key objectives such as improving claim approval rates, reducing processing time, and detecting fraud. Data is collected from both primary sources (hospital claim management systems) and secondary sources (insurance reports), followed by cleaning, transformation, and storage in secure databases.

                        Statistical analysis and visualizations are performed to uncover patterns and insights, which are then presented to hospital management. The process concludes with implementing recommendations and continuously monitoring the system for improvement.<p>

                    <p>This Data Analysis Workflow provides a concise framework for conducting data-driven projects, from setting objectives to implementing recommendations. The process begins by defining the analysis goals, followed by data collection and storage. Once the data is secured, it undergoes cleaning to ensure accuracy, with feedback loops in place for repeated refinement if needed.

                        Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps uncover initial insights, after which SQL queries and data transformations prepare the data for statistical analysis. The insights are then visualized, allowing stakeholders to assess the clarity of results. If necessary, further exploration is conducted to refine the findings.
                        
                        When the insights are clear, a Power BI dashboard is created to support decision-making. The results are interpreted, reported, and presented to stakeholders, followed by the implementation of actionable recommendations. Finally, continuous monitoring ensures that the process remains iterative and adaptable, with opportunities for further improvements as new data emerges.</p>

                        This flowchart outlines the Product Development Life Cycle, starting with Idea Generation and moving through stages like Concept Development, Feasibility Study, Design, Prototyping, and Testing. After passing Market and Business Analysis, the product undergoes Development, Quality Assurance, and Manufacturing before Market Launch. The process ends with a Post-Launch Evaluation, leading to either Continuous Improvement or Redesign/Discontinuation based on success. Decision points and feedback loops guide each step</p>
